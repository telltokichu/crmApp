```

The optimized static files will be generated inside the dist/ folder.

## üì¶ Justification for the Chosen State Management Library

For state management, we have chosen **Redux Toolkit** (RTK) for the following reasons:

1. **Standardization and Best Practices**:  
   Redux Toolkit is the officially recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It enforces best practices such as immutability, structured slices, and cleaner action handling out of the box.

2. **Scalability and Predictability**:  
   Given that the project involves managing authentication flows, role-based access control, and complex policy data, Redux Toolkit offers a predictable and centralized store architecture which will be easier to scale and maintain as the project grows.

3. **Simplified Redux Development**:  
   RTK abstracts a lot of the boilerplate that classic Redux required (e.g., separate action types, action creators, reducers), making it faster and cleaner to build state logic using slices and async thunks.

4. **Efficient Async Handling**:  
   With `createAsyncThunk` and integrated middleware support, RTK provides a powerful way to handle asynchronous operations like API calls to Supabase (e.g., login, fetch policies) while automatically managing loading, success, and error states.

5. **Strong TypeScript Support**:  
   Redux Toolkit is built with TypeScript in mind. It ensures type safety across the actions, reducers, and selectors, minimizing runtime errors and improving developer experience.

6. **Community Adoption and Ecosystem**:  
   RTK is widely adopted across the React community, ensuring excellent documentation, ongoing maintenance, and compatibility with other libraries like React Query, Formik, and even Supabase client SDK.

7. **Future Integration Ready**:  
   As the project plans to add features like dashboard analytics, dynamic filtering, pagination, and real-time updates, Redux Toolkit provides a robust foundation for managing derived state and complex UI states.

### Summary:

Redux Toolkit strikes the right balance between **simplicity, structure, and scalability**, making it the ideal choice for this project given the expected complexity of authentication, role-based control, and data visualization features.
